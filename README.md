# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions to puzzles from this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Running the solutions

If you've built a Rust binary before, just checkout my repository and run `cargo run --release --bin day-<num>` (with `<num>` being the day you want to run the solution for).

To run these solutions with your dataset, dump your own data file that you can download from `https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/<num>/input` (once you login) into `data/day-<num>.in`, and then run the `cargo run --release --bin day-<num>` command.
